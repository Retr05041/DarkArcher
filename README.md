*"The last file server you will ever need"*

***Dark Archer*** is the successor to [Archer-FS](https://github.com/Retr05041/Archer-FS) which was a project I started back in November of 2021.
Now that my skills have increased and my need for this project to be a success has skyrocketed, I have decided to revamp the project into what it is now.

## Whats this built off of?
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) : For the runtime environment
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) : For the backend api
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) : For the front end UI
- [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) : For reverse proxy and serving UI

## Plans for the future?
[V1-Alpha](https://github.com/Retr05041/DarkArcher/tree/V1-Alpha) is out!

The next steps are to create a better UI, fix up some random greviences, and add a proper login screen!
