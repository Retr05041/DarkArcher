***Dark Archer*** is the successor to [Archer-FS](https://github.com/Retr05041/Archer-FS) which was a project I started back in November of 2021.
Now that my skills have increased and my need for this project to be a success has skyrocketed, I have decided to revamp the project into what it is now.

## What am I building this off of?
- Node.js : For the runtime environment
- Express.js : For the backend framework
- React.js : For the front end UI

## Plans for the future?
At the moment, V1 of the app is still being designed and made.

The current plan is as follows:
- Create a working, basic V1
- Create a Docker image of V1 and make new branch for it, for easy cross platform usability
- Add features / expand on the app, make a login screen, etc.
